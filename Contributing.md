# Contributing to Quantitative Analysis of Stock Market using Python

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **Quantitative Analysis of Stock Market using Python** project!  
This repository aims to provide hands‑on, open‑source analysis of stock market data — from time‑series, risk/return analysis, correlation studies, predictive modelling, and more. All contributions — small enhancements or major features — are welcome and appreciated.

## 🏆 How You Can Contribute

- **Data Enhancements**: Add historical stock data, include additional markets/countries, merge alternative datasets (volume, macro‑data, sentiment), improve data cleaning or preprocessing.  
- **Model Improvements**: Explore and compare regression, classification, time‑series forecasting (ARIMA, LSTM, GRU, Transformer), optimise hyperparameters, and increase model interpretability.  
- **Visualisation & Analysis**: Create interactive plots, dashboards, risk/return scatter plots, heatmaps of correlations, rolling‑window analysis, portfolio simulations, and share insights.  
- **Documentation & Tutorials**: Improve the README, add beginner‑friendly walkthroughs, notebooks showing how to run the pipeline, usage examples, explanation of financial metrics and model results.  
- **Testing & Reproducibility**: Ensure scripts/notebooks run end‑to‑end, include sample datasets, add tests or integration check‑lists, improve code modularity and clarity.
